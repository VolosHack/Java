Account class

Create a class called Account that includes one instance variable— the account's balance (type double). Provide a constructor that initializes the  instance variable, only if the initial balance is positive. Provide a credit method that adds an amount to the current balance and a get method that returns the balance.Write a test application named AccountTest that demonstrates class Account’s capabilities. Create two Account objects and try giving one a positive initial balance and the other a negative, then print both objects' balance. Then ask the user for a deposit amount for the first account, add the amount to the balance and print the  balance of the objects.Repeat for the second account.
